## 1. Preparation

- Install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)

- If you have a Mac, git is included (type ``git --version`` in terminal to confirm). 

	- **Important note**: If you recently updated your OSX version, and are getting ``missing xcrun`` error messages, you need to install XCODE as well as the commandline tools. Try: ``xcode --install`` in the terminal.

- Install [GitKraken - A GUI ``git`` client](https://www.gitkraken.com/) for your operating system 

- Make a free GitHub account and keep your user/password combination handy

- If you haven't yet signed up for the Slack channel, please do so. We will not send out weekly emails to everyone about next week's preppp.  All details will be posted to GitHub and a notification about it will be sent to the Slack Channel.

- Bring a recent project. This should include:

	- Data analysis code in any language (R, Python, BASH, Java -- whatever floats your boat)

	- A text file containing description of the analysis

	- One or two (or more if you wish) figures

	- Alternatively (in lieu of both items above), bring another academic product of yours. 

- We will typset these contents using Markdown, create a local project and then learn to archive it on GitHub using:

	- ``Commandline`` version of git
	
	- ``GitKraken`` i.e. the GUI version of git
 


## 2. Highlights of the Session

Here is what we accomplished in today's session:

- Converted a plain text file containing a short Git tutorial into Markdown format. Some of the new Markdown commands we learned included:

	- Making hyperlinks

	- Inserting images using html snippets

	- Formatting code by applying backtick enclosures

	- Using a Cascading Style Sheet to render the document in HTML format

	- Using Pandoc document converter in combination with CSS

- Using version control system, ``git``.

	- Creating a new local repo

	- Initializing it with git

	- Staging files for deployment to GitHub

	- Committing changes you have made to files

	- Configuring git with your user/email, and empty GitHub repository address

	- Pushing local changes to GitHub

	- Resolving any issues encountered


- All the data used for today's repo was made available on Dropbox via  link posted too Zoom chat as well as the Slack channel.
