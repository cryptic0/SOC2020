# May 26, 2020: Publishing with Markdown

## 0. Preparation

- [Install Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html), the versatile document converter

- Install a suitable text editor.  Here are a few examples:

	- ``Vi`` / ``Vim``, the standard text editor of the Unix world (free)
	- ``Textwrangler`` or ``BBEdit`` (not free)
	- ``Atom``
	- ``Notepad++`` (but not just Notepad or Wordpad)

- Bring a sample of one of your recent products.  This could be a term paper, a publication, an excerpt from your thesis/dissertation, or a tutorial you may have developed or something else along those lines.  You do not need to share this with others, it's for your own use only.  

- Bring questions and comments about your own workflows.  We will reserve the last 30 minutes for this.  Remember that this is a forum, so let the information flow in all directions.

## Highlights of the May 26 Session

- Brief introduction to ``Vim`` and ``Macvim`` (the graphical interface of ``vim``).

- Creating new files, saving changes, closing and reopening text files

- Relevance of file name extensions

- Brief iontroduction to Markdown syntax such as:

	- Write document preamble (title, author, date etc.)
	- How to make section headings
	- Write in **boldface** and **italic**
	- Enclose code snippets within backticks to make them appear color coded

- Compiling ``html`` output from ``.md`` (Markdown) formatted files

- Using a Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to enhance output html formatting.  The example we used was the stylesheet ``screen.css`` from the GitHub repository: [https://github.com/ebidel/markdown-css-themes](https://github.com/ebidel/markdown-css-themes).


## Zoom Video Recordings

- Some people requested videorecording of the session.  For now I will be making them available for download on the Teton Computing Environment.  If you have access to the server, the first video will be available after 12pm MDT on 05/27.  Please see ``/project/inbre-train/summercode/``.

- If you are a CC person and do not have access to Teton, please email us at wyoinbre at gmail and we will figure out another way for you to access the files.
